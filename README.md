# Youtube-Redux-Stylus-Themes
REMINDER. THESE RELY HEAVILY ON HAVING YOUTUBE REDUX INSTALLED.. THEY WILL PROBABLY LOOK REALLY ASS WITHOUT IT.

My themes for youtube redux (stylus)
(these are super buggy and not very good.) 
(things like the 2011 video player thing are other peoples projects mixed together, they were super broken so I fixed em)

To Install, just make a new stylus theme and paste all the stuff in the .txt into it. Save and enable. (Since there are multiple .txts make multiple themes for them, DO NOT USE THEM ALL AT THE SAME TIME, some of these conflict with each other, though u can use the 2011 video player with both, should be fine.)

(MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUTUBE REDUX INSTALLED)
